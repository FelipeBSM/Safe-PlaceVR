# Safe-PlaceVR

This repository contains a custom Ray Tracing code developed in C++, based on the book "Ray Tracing in One Weekend". The project includes the implementation of a simple renderer that generates images using Ray Tracing techniques to simulate lighting and shadow effects in 3D scenes. The generated images are initially saved in .ppm format and converted to PNG for easier viewing. The code supports configurations to produce results with different quality levels (Grade A and Grade B) and includes adjustable filters for both grades.

Check the result folder to view the rendered images.
